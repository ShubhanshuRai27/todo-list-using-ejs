# Task02


Write a js program in `src/backend/databases/sqlite.js` to create an SQLite database in the same directory, with the name `database.sqlite`.

 Give storage path for the database as`"./src/backend/databases/database.sqlite"`

The DB will have two tables: `users` (for users) and `lists` (for to-dos).

The structure of the tables is given below(Stretch the pane for more visibility):

user table:


| id (PRIMARY KEY) | name     | email    | password |
| ---------------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| (NUMBER)         | (STRING) | (STRING) | (STRING) |
|                  |          |          |          |


lists table:

| id (PRIMARY KEY) | item     | edit      | done     | user_id  |
| ---------------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | -------- |
| (NUMBER)         | (STRING) | (BOOLEAN) | (STRING) | (NUMBER) |
|                  |          |           |          |          |

Note that the id column in the table is automatically generated, so you need not specify that.
