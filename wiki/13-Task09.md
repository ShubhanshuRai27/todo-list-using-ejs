# Task09

Finalize your app

In this task, you are required to add some styling to the app. More points will be given to the better-designed app.  
Manually test your app by adding different users and to-dos for those users.
The top apps will be reviewed by the authors and will be featured on KONFINITY. So take some time to make your app beautiful and responsive before submitting this task.

**Note:** Usage of Bootstrap is not recommended for making the layout. Rather use Native CSS GRID or FLEX.

**Note:** Before pushing your codes online delete your database file and
      create a user account with given credentials
      
**Note:** After uploading your final code online, if you see that your pipeline has __passed__ all test cases but still doesn't show __passed__ status in pipeline then, raise an issue regarding this in your workspace stating `test cases has been passed but pipeline is not updating the same`.
