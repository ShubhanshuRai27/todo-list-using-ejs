In the following tasks, you'll be building a responsive to-do app.

To get an idea of the app you'll be building, [Click Here](http://13.233.55.172:4000)

This app must include the following features:

- The ability of a user to Sign-in / Signup.
- The ability for users to create, edit and delete their to-dos.
- The ability for a user to Signout.

Your app must open the sign-in page if the user is not signed-in, from there, he/she can either sign-in or choose to open the sign-up page from where an account can be created.
After signing in or up, the user will be shown on the profile page on which he/she can manage the to-dos.
If the user opens the homepage, sign-in page or sign-up page again, he/she will be redirected to his/her profile page.
To sign-in again, the user will be required to sign out first.

For this, you'll be required to store the signed-in user session using `express-sessions`
